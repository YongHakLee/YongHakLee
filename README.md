### ðŸ”­ My Main Research & Project

My primary focus is on **automated 3D object measurement using data fusion from mobile LiDAR sensors and 2D RGB images**. I believe this approach has immense potential to revolutionize industries like augmented reality, personalized e-commerce, and autonomous systems.

The core workflow of my research involves:
1.  **Data Acquisition:** Capturing synchronized **2D RGB images and 3D Depth maps** from mobile devices (e.g., iPhone/iPad Pro).
2.  **2D Analysis:** Utilizing Deep Learning models (like **HRNet, Mask R-CNN, YOLO**) to automatically detect keypoints or segment areas of interest in the 2D image.
3.  **Sensor Fusion:** Projecting the 2D detection results onto the 3D depth map to acquire precise spatial coordinates.
4.  **3D Measurement:** Calculating real-world dimensions such as **length, circumference, and area** from the fused 3D point data.

This lightweight and accessible approach eliminates the need for expensive, specialized 3D scanning equipment.
