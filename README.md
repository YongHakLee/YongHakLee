# Hi, I'm YongHakLee. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Vision Engineer specializing in 3D perception and data processing. With a strong background in analyzing complex visual data, including images and LiDAR point clouds, I am passionate about building the "eyes" for intelligent systems.

My goal is to leverage my expertise in perception to contribute to the field of robotics, developing robust and autonomous machines that can intelligently interact with the physical world. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills to challenges in robotic navigation, manipulation, and interaction.

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning and working on...

To bridge my computer vision skills with robotics, I am focusing on the following areas:

- **Robot Operating System (ROS/ROS2)**: Building nodes for perception tasks and understanding the publisher/subscriber architecture.
- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: Implementing and experimenting with algorithms like ORB-SLAM and LIO-SAM.
- **Motion Planning & Control**: Studying pathfinding algorithms (A*, RRT) and basic control theory for robot manipulators.
- **Robotics Simulation**: Gaining hands-on experience with simulators like **Gazebo** and **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**.
